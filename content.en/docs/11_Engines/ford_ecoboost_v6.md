For 2017, the original 3.5-liter has been completely redesigned from the sump up. The basic dimensions including bore-spacing and deck height are retained to avoid a costly retooling of the block machining line at the Cleveland engine plant that produces it, but otherwise virtually every part is new including the block and cylinder heads.  

The single most significant change to the engine is a new dual fuel system that now includes both port and direct injection. Since the beginning, direct injection (DI) and turbocharging have been the defining characteristics of EcoBoost engines. DI enables the use of higher boost and compression ratios that improve torque and driveability by cooling down the compressed air that the turbos push into the cylinders. They also enable greater fuel delivery precision for better fuel economy and emissions in most conditions. However, at higher flow rates the need for larger holes in the injectors detracts from the flow control resolution.   

Gasoline DI engines are also prone to produce higher levels of particulate emissions, especially following a cold start when the fuel is sprayed on cold cylinder walls. The new Tier III emissions regulations that go into effect in 2018 significantly reduce the amount of particulates that all engines are allowed to emit. Al Cockerill, Ford engine systems supervisor for the 3.5-liter engine acknowledges that the addition of port injection will enable this new engine to meet Tier III emissions standards without resorting to a particulate filter of the type that is required on modern diesel engines.
