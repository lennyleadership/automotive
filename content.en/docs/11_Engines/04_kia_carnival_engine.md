The Carnival engine is Smartstream G3.5 GDi which has two injection systems - a Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) and Multi-Port Injection (MPI). Duel fuel injection is 2 port injectors per cylinder and Center injection is direct injection. Direct port injection is in the cylinder head, multi-port injection is in the intake.

When direct injection began propagating through the auto industry, walls in the intake, intake chamber and intake valve of the head was being found much dirtier than with injection in the intake. Where does the mess come from? The positive crankcase ventilation system.

The fuel additive will not help carbon buildup on the intake valves as the engine in our Kia's are direct injection they spray directly into the combustion chamber.

no need to add additive every oil change.

No need for a catch can with dual injection (direct and port), it would actually cause issues if you have to make a warranty claim. Best is to use top tier gas and don't do anything.

There are many factors that cause the carbon deposits, the manual states to use the "top tier" gas which is gasoline regardless of octane rating that contains detergents and dispersants typically sold by reputable gas stations. The manual also states you may use a fuel treatment like the Techron. Other factors that cause carbon deposits are malfunctions, <b>very short trips, short trips, extended engine idling, extended low rpm driving, engine oil quality & oil change intervals</b>. There are mountains of information to research on the topic as well as mitigation, maintenance / wizardry and engine oil / oil change intervals etc. 

Everyone with a direct injection engine should check their engine oil level, and maintain their vehicle at the regularly scheduled intervals per the owner's manual (or sooner! never do extended OCI's).
